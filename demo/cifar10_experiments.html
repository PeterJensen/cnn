  <h1>CIFAR-10 Experiments</h1>
  <p>These experiments are using a modified version of the amazing 
     <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/">convnet.js</a> framework.
     This framework enables users to define a multi layer neural network.  Features for
     both training and inference are available for the custom network.  I've experimented with the
    <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">cifar10 data set</a> for the experiments below.</p>

  <h2><a href="./cifar10_test.html">Using Web Workers</a></h2>
  <p>This experiment uses Web Workers for the forward computation of the convolution layers
     in a pre-trained network.  The various layers form a pipeline, where each convolution
     stage in the pipeline has a dedicated Web Worker.  Performance profiling reveals that
     the convolution layers are responsible for the majority of the compute time required.
     By using Web Workers the per image processing time is cut roughly in half.  Clik the
     title of this paragraph to see for yourself.</p>

  <h2><a href="./cifar10_cam.html">Using camera input for processing</a></h2>
  <p>This experiment will capture frames from the webcam and categorize what it sees into
     the 10 different categories used by the cifar10 tests.  Try it for yourself by clicking
     the title of this paragraph.  There's also a short video of me playing with this here:</p>
